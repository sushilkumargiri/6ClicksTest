Assumptions:
1. OOPS Skills
	a. Create a web application to print receipt.
	b. Do not create UI to feed input data(just focus on class structure). hard code the input data somewhere in the solution.
	c. Input price are base price. For example "1 book at $12.49" means there is one book at base price of $12.46 and sale tax will be applied on top of this values.
	d. "Total Cost Price" is price before tax.

2. SQl Skills
	a. Question is: Write a query that returns the name of a student with class who has scored the highest marks in the class.
		And, Table Students has columns Id, Name, Class, Marks. This table has all the data required to solve the first problem.
	b. Pivot is done only for 2 subjects "English" & "Maths". Include other subjects in query if required.
3. Overall problem-solving skills
	a. Only database design is done for this problem. There is no User interface or business logic implemented.

Description:
1. OOPS Skills
Look at class InputData for input values(modify accordingly for testing)

2. SQl Skills
Look at SQL.txt file for the queries

3.Overall problem-solving skills
